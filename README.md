# AnonDocs
AnonDocs Secure is a privacy-first document editor that enables you to create, share, and manage encrypted documents with self-destructing capabilities. Unlike cloud-based alternatives, all encryption happens client-side in your browser using the Web Crypto API—your data never leaves your device unencrypted.
