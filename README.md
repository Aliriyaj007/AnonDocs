# AnonDocs — Private & Anonymous

AnonDocs is a lightweight, privacy-first document editor built with **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Highlights
- Google Docs-like editing experience (compact toolbar, fonts, headings, lists).
- Autosave to `localStorage` and local document management.
- **Password-protected shareable links** (AES encryption) and public base64 links — self-contained URLs.
- Shared Links Manager (copy, open, revoke, toggle public/private).
- View-only shared viewer with option to save a local copy.
- Print — prints only the document content.
- Light, Dark, and Colored themes; first-time tooltips for user guidance.
- Fully client-side — no server required (optional server can be added for centralized link persistence).

## Files
- `index.html` — UI and markup
- `style.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `app.js` — application logic (documents, sharing, UI)
