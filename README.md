# AnonDocs ‚Äî Minimal, Private Docs

AnonDocs is a lightweight, privacy-focused, offline-capable writing app built with **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides a Google-Docs‚Äìinspired writing experience with password-protected sharing, saved shared-link management, printing of document content only, autosave, light/dark theme, and more.

## Files

- `index.html` ‚Äî main app shell, UI, modals.
- `style.css` ‚Äî styling and responsive layout.
- `app.js` ‚Äî all application logic (documents, sharing, printing, UI).
- (Optional) `assets/` ‚Äî place screenshots or demo images if you want.

---

## How to run

1. Put `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` in the same folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox recommended).  
3. Or upload to a GitHub repository and enable **GitHub Pages** from repository Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí main ‚Üí root to publish.

## How sharing works

- **Private link**: You set a password. The app AES-encrypts the document payload and produces a `?shared=PRV:<cipher>` URL. The receiver must enter the password to decrypt and view.
- **Public link**: The app creates a base64 payload `?shared=PUB:<base64>` that anyone can open.
- **Expiry**: You can set expiry (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or never). Expired links cannot be opened.
- **Shared Links Manager**: saved links appear in the "Shared Links" modal where you can copy, open, toggle public/private, or revoke.

> Note: passwords are **not** stored by the app ‚Äî if you forget the password for a private link, the data cannot be recovered.

---

## Printing

Use the **Print** button ‚Äî the app opens a minimal print window containing only the document HTML (images preserved), then calls `window.print()` so the page UI is not printed.

---

## Security notes

- Private links use AES encryption (via CryptoJS) ‚Äî password is required to decrypt.
- The app strips `<script>` tags from imported content to lower XSS risk.
- Data is stored in `localStorage` only. If you want server-backed sync/persistence, a small server or serverless function would be required.

---

## Next steps / Improvements

- Optional server for persistent shared links (so links survive device storage loss).
- Convert to a PWA to install and work fully offline with an app icon.
- Replace `document.execCommand` with a modern editor engine for richer features (collaboration, diffing).
- Add permissions & link access control (email-based invites) via a backend.

If you want, I can:
- Split `app.js` into modules and add inline documentation.
- Create a `README` with screenshots (I can generate mockups).
- Help you set up GitHub Pages and push these files to a repo.
